# Pix2Pix-Image-Colorizer

Deep Neural Network to colorize images in black and white colors using the Pix2Pix Architecture. Documentation can be found in TPF Redes Neuronales (in Spanish).

# Introduction

The Pix2Pix architecture has proven effective for natural images, and the authors of the original paper claim that it can perform well the problem of image-to-image translation. However, synthetic images may present a challenging use scenario. 

In this work, we use the Pix2Pix architecture for a colorization of art pictures in black and white.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this work is the `Art Images: Drawing/Painting/Sculptures/Engravings.` provided in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thedownhill/art-images-drawings-painting-sculpture-engraving). The dataset consist of images of artworks in different forms, such as Drawings, Sculptures, etc. However, in this work we used only the Draweings part of the dataset discarding the rest.

Here you can see some examples of this dataset:
